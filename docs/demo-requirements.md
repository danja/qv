 * Marc Canter: "We're using Parse and Firebase and building on top of Layer. We also have started converting everything over to using Facebook's React Native. We're basing everything on Apple's Messages. On-boarding and learning curve should as close to zero as possible, When in doubt, defer to Apple".
